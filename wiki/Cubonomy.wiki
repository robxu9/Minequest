#This describes the cubonomy sections of MineQuest.

= Introduction =

Cubonomy was the name of the plugin that I developed for Hey0. It was an in game economy which would vary prices based on how much was sold or bought. It was also a closed economy system, making it so no material would be produced from it, it would simply be shifted between players.

Now I have taken all of the aspects of that plugin and merged them into MineQuest to form the economy system for it. While a few interface things have changed and the prices vary more finely with the market, it at its heart is still cubonomy.


= Commands =

Details about commands will be here soon.
