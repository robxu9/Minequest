= Known Issues for MineQuest =

== Instanced Dungeons (Should be Fixed) ==

Re-spawning of doors does not work properly. If a door has been used in a previous instance then it will keep the state of whether or not it was open. Also if a door is removed, such a steel door, it will not re-spawn correctly currently.

== Re-spawn Glitch ==

On rare occasion people report to me that they have died, dropped all of their stuff, then they click re-spawn and stay where they are standing, and then when they really die all of their stuff is gone. I think this was an issue related to pvp not being fully implemented, so it should be fixed now. If it happens to you please feel free to let me know.

== Ability Disabling ==
Leveling up will cause all of your passive abilities to be disabled.
